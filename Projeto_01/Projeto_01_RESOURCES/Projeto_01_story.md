You are sitting on a corner watching the guests drink and dance and laugh. You catch a glimpse of your beloved.

When you are finally able to reach them across the room, through a wave of alarmed guests, you find their lifeless body lying on the floor.

## **DECISION #1** - find the killer 

At this very moment, it feels like the ground has been pulled from under you.  
Everything goes silent, and the world is moving both too fast and too slow. You have a decision to make. 
Will you give in to grief, or will you set out to find who did this, and why? 

[1] I will lie down next to the one I love and mourn them.  
[2] I will find the one who did this and avenge their death.  

Choose your answer! [1 / 2] 

[1] You drop down to the floor and cry. You do not know how much time has passed, but you look out and see it is morning.  
You are alone. Through the window, you see your brother running towards the house, and waving wildly at you. 
At first, you can't quite make out what he is saying. But as he gets closer, you understand. He is frantically announcing: "They found the murderer!" 

[2] (+1 courage) You compose yourself at once and shouts at the guards to bar the doors. No one leaves until you find the one who did this. 
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a server drop something, and cautiously start heading to the kitchens. 
Your brother, who is standing by your side sees the same thing. He seizes the suspect, and you inspect the vial that has been dropped. 
You take a whiff and get a hint of almonds. Cyanide.

## **DECISION #2** - discover the motive 

They bring the accused forward. It is just one of the servants from the kitchens. You stand there for a minute, puzzled. 
What motive could they possibly have? Your betrothed was loved by all, nobles and commonfolk alike. So why would someone do this? 
You interrogate the server, but they are not saying anything. Will your persuasion techniques be enough to convince them to talk? 

(Roll the dice for results) 

If you chose persuasion as one of your attributes, you will have a +(persuasion) bonus to your roll. 
If you roll 1, 2, or 3, you will not be able to persuade the servant into exposing their motives. 
If you roll 4, 5, or 6, you will discover the reason behind your spouse's murder. 

[1,2,3] You try your best, but they are unyielding. You might never know why this tragedy was brought upon you. 

[4,5,6] (+1 persuasion) After hours of interrogation, despair fills you, as you realize you might never know why this tragedy was brought upon you. 
In a frail last attempt to uncover the truth, you drop down to your knees and begs them to please tell you why, why they had to take away what is most precious to you. 
Moved by this unexpected display of emotion, they confess. It was love and jealousy, the masterminds of this crime. 
You were the object of their passion for many years, and when you found love yourself, they could not bear the thought of seeing you with another.

## **DECISION #3** - the killer's fate 1 

Opinions are divided. Some claim there is no excuse for what this person did. They should be executed without delay. 
Others believe it is not in their hands to judge, and the accused deserves a fair trial. What will it be? 

[1] You are outraged that anyone would think you would commit such a heinous act! You take the killer to justice. 
[2] How can they keep breathing when your beloved breathes no more? You draw your sword. 

Choose your answer! [1 / 2] 

[1] (+1 Justice) 

[2] (-1 Justice) Somehow, the server gets ahold of a sword. The execution turns into a duel. What will you do? 

(jokenpo for results) 

ATTACK beats DEFEND
DEFEND beats PARRY
PARRY beats ATTACK 

[1] Attack 
[2] Defend 
[3] Parry 

Your move:  

You: XXX | your opponent: XXX 

[WIN] (+1 Strength) You win the fight. You lift your sword for the final blow, but the guards stop you. This is not your decision to make. 

[LOSE] You are at your opponent's mercy. A swift blow and you would be dead. They take pity on you though, drop the sword, and let the guards guide them to the dungeons. 

It's a DRAW!

## **DECISION #4** - the killer's fate 2 

The time has come to decide the murderer's fate. All are here. Judge, jury, and every soul for miles around.  
You know the judge will heed your words. You know you have power here.  
You hear people scream and curse and call for the gallows.  
You think about that for a moment. Seems fair. Logical, even. A life for a life.  
You also hear people pleading for mercy. Mercy... The word echoes in you. 
You are not too sure now, are you? Well, there is no more time to think.  
The judge calls your name. It is your turn to speak. What will you say? 

[1] "My friend, what IS there to say? What I held closest to my heart has been ripped from me in the cruelest of ways.  
There is no other way. The killer should hang." 

[2] You say nothing at first. You consider it a bit more. It feels right. But the words are caught in your throat, tears flood your eyes. 
Hesitantly, you look up. Only two syllables escape your lips. The ones that have been ringing between your ears... "Mercy". 

Choose your answer! [1 / 2] 

[1] The sentence is carried out, but it does not give you any comfort or closure. You head home with a heavy heart.

[2] (+1 Compassion) The judge nods his head, and sentences the accused to 30 years.
